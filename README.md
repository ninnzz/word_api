=====

Introduction
-----
A boilerplate for REST APIs implement using python flask. Ideal for doing micro services and API integrations.

#### Running the app
- Runs on Python 3.4+
- Install Python3 and pip3
- Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Start the server `python3 run.py`

```


#### Implementing a module
```
    +-- module/
    |   +-- __init__.py
    |   +-- dispatch.py
    |   +-- model.py
```
###### dispatch
Dispatch is where you store all the request related context. The following are handled by `dispatch.py`
- reuqest handling
- response handling
- routing of request
- authentication

We need to make sure that the request context does not mix with any of the app logic.

###### model
Model is the the one that handles the transactional operations.
- Insert
- Update
- Get
- Search
- Delete
